1. It's constant...so 1.

2. It's n. It's the last item in the collection.

3. This is going to be a loglinear time complexity
due to the fact there is is a sub-collection which slows the
process down.

4. I think this is also loglinear because of the
recursive call.

5. I think this is linear because it appears to be iterating.

6. I think this is logarithmic because of the high and low value
settings. It's quite similar to binary search.
