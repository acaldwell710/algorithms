1. It's constant...so 1.

2. It's n. It's the last item in the collection.

3. This is going to be a linear time complexity
due to the fact this is iterating over each item in the collection,
and no matter the size of the collection largest can't be found and
returned until each item is compared to largest within the collection.

4. I think this is constant because no matter what integer is the first to
come, an answer will be returned for it.

5. I think this is linear because it appears to be iterating.

6. I think this is logarithmic because of the high and low value
settings. It's quite similar to binary search.
