version 1: This has a collection and a sub-collection. I think the complexity
is loglinear. O(n log n)

version 2: This was essentially an insertion sort. An insertion sort is
linear time complexity. O(n)

version 3: This was essentially a merge sort. Therefore, the complexity was
loglinear. O(n log n)
